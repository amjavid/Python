1. With online material I just tried to understand the problem statement
	a. Create 4 classes: Bank, Customer, Account, SavigsAccount
	b. In which Bank super class (as per my understanding)
	c. Account inherit's Bank
	d. SavigsAccount inherit's Account
	e. And Customer is a solo class, whose type obj will be inside Account class
	f. Create a new class (no namme mention), so I choose as NewUser
	   Which basically accepts iputs from user, which will be used basically for creating new account.
	   
2. With above information and there was comments to use parameterized constructor and use super
3. I just started and added some flavour on while logic to ask get input option from user for performing transaction.


I just referred online self learning material completely to complete this task as per my understanding on the problem statement. And I didn't felt need of browsing.
